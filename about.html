        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Sruja — a computer science student, developer, and researcher in the making. I’m not here to daydream about the future. I’m here to build it — through code, consistent learning, and projects that push limits. From machine learning pipelines to hands-on hardware experiments, I work on things that teach me more than any lecture ever could.</p>
        <p>I’m serious about my craft, intentional with my time, and always up for a challenge that forces me to level up. I don’t just want to know how things work — I want to make them work better.</p>

        <h2>Let’s Build Something Brave</h2>
        <p>I’m always looking to collaborate with people who want to shake things up — designers, engineers, scientists, investors, you name it. If you’re working on something exciting, or just want to connect, reach out. Let's make it happen.</p>
